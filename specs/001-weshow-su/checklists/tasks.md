# Tasks Quality Checklist: Исправление критических проблем weshow.su

**Purpose**: Validate task completeness and implementation readiness  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [tasks.md](./tasks.md)

## Task Organization

- [x] Tasks organized by user story (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- [x] Each user story can be implemented independently
- [x] Clear task dependencies identified with [P] markers
- [x] Specific file paths included in task descriptions
- [x] Tasks follow logical implementation order

## Task Completeness

- [x] All user stories from spec.md have corresponding tasks
- [x] Critical fixes (P1) prioritized in Phase 1
- [x] Performance optimizations (P2) in Phase 2
- [x] Monitoring and quality tasks in Phase 3
- [x] Testing tasks included for validation
- [x] Documentation tasks for knowledge transfer

## Implementation Readiness

- [x] Tasks include specific file paths for implementation
- [x] Dependencies clearly marked with [P] for parallel execution
- [x] Success criteria validation tasks included

- [x] Rollback procedures documented

## Technical Accuracy

- [x] Tasks align with technical plan from plan.md
- [x] Data model requirements reflected in tasks
- [x] React Query integration tasks included
- [x] Supabase optimization tasks specified
- [x] Performance monitoring tasks defined

## Quality Assurance

- [x] Testing tasks for each major component
- [x] Performance validation tasks
- [x] Accessibility testing included
